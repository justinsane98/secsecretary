The proposed rule would direct the national securities exchanges and national securities associations to establish listing standards that would require each issuer to develop and implement a policy providing for the recovery, under certain circumstances, of incentive-based compensation based on financial information required to be reported under the securities laws that is received by current or former executive officers, and require disclosure of the policy (the ``Proposed Rules&#39;&#39;). The Proposed Rules were set forth in a release published in the Federal Register on July 14, 2015 (Release No. 34-75342) (the ``Proposing Release&#39;&#39;), and the related comment period ended on September 14, 2015. The reopening of this comment period is intended to allow interested persons further opportunity to analyze and comment upon the Proposed Rules in light of developments since the publication of the Proposing Release and our further consideration of the Section 954 mandate.","guid":"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/10/21/2021-22754/reopening-of-comment-period-for-listing-standards-for-recovery-of-erroneously-awarded-compensation","pubDate":"Thu, 21 Oct 2021 04:00:00 GMT","title":"Reopening of Comment Period for Listing Standards for Recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation","link":"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/10/21/2021-22754/reopening-of-comment-period-for-listing-standards-for-recovery-of-erroneously-awarded-compensation"},{"content":"","guid":"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/10/21/2021-23108/sunshine-act-meetings","pubDate":"Thu, 21 Oct 2021 04:00:00 GMT","title":"Sunshine Act Meetings","link":"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/10/21/2021-23108/sunshine-act-meetings"},{"content":"","guid":"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/10/21/2021-22935/self-regulatory-organizations-nyse-chicago-inc-notice-of-filing-and-immediate-effectiveness-of","pubDate":"Thu, 21 Oct 2021 04:00:00 GMT","title":"Self-Regulatory Organizations;
